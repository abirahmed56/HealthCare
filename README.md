The expected outcomes of the HealthCare App project include the successful development and deployment of a user-friendly and efficient mobile application that addresses
critical health needs during emergencies. The app aims to contribute to public health
by providing timely access to medical assistance, facilitating blood donation, offering
COVID-19 resources, and ensuring convenient access to medicines.
